                <p>
                    We have developed methods for finding associations among the heterogeneous data types in TCGA data. This includes the construction of a feature
                    matrix: a large, heterogeneous matrix which combines virtually all available information regarding patients and samples for a given tumor
                    type. The feature matrix is created by parsing and standardizing both public and protected TCGA data available through the DCC: clinical,
                    mRNA (gene) expression, DNA methylation, microRNA expression, copy number variation, somatic (DNA) mutation data, and RPPA (protein) data.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Our Center has also incorporated other sources of information from the Genome Characterization Centers and other Genome Data Analysis Centers within TCGA.  This mixed-type feature matrix includes numerical
                    data (both continuous and discrete) and arbitrary unordered categorical data, while also allowing for missing values, a critical factor when
                    working with biomedical data.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Typical matrices include 20,000 to 50,000 features describing 200 to 1000 tumor samples, and provide a starting-point for all of our downstream
                    analyses, as well as a simple, standardized format for data-sharing between collaborators. From the feature matrix, we derive statistically
                    significant Pairwise Associations, and multivariate associations through Random Forest analysis.  Pairwise Association analysis has been performed systematically for every tumor analysis working group where the Center has been a participant.

                    TCGA data. Associations are primarily displayed within the context of genomic coordinates. However, other views may also be used to evaluate
                    associations, including graphs and tables. Two dimensional distributions of feature pairs (identified by association analysis), are also provided
                    for further investigation.

                <h4>Colorectal Cancer Aggressiveness Explorer</h4>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    The CRC Aggressiveness Explorer allows the exploration of molecular signatures associated with aggressive CRC, as described in Comprehensive
                    Molecular Characterization of Human Colon and Rectal Tumors (manuscript in press). A molecular signature can be one of a variety of types: a
                    change in the transcription level of a protein-coding gene or a microRNA, a somatic mutation, a somatic copy number alteration, or the change
                    in DNA methylation near a gene promoter. Each signature has a score indicating the statistical significance of the evidence for its association
                    with tumor aggressiveness. The score is a composite of individual association scores for tumor stage, the fraction of positive lymph nodes in
                    the vicinity of the tumor, histological type (mucinous or non-mucinous carcinoma), and for the presence or absence of vascular invasion,
                    lymphatic invasion, and distant metastasis. A positive score implies that the signature is more prevalent in tumors with aggressive colorectal
                    cancer, while a negative score indicates the opposite. In the CRC Aggressiveness Explorer, these are shown in red and blue respectively, with a
                    color gradient for the strength of association.

                        <p>
                            The impact of somatic mutations are assessed by including protein domain-level binarization as features in pairwise statistical tests
                            of heterogeneous TCGA data. Somatic mutation data is converted into protein domain information via a pipeline which incorporates the
                            software tool <a href="http://www.openbioinformatics.org/annovar" target="_blank">ANNOVAR</a> (reference: Wang K, Li M, Hakonarson H.
                            ANNOVAR: Functional annotation of genetic variants from next-generation sequencing data Nucleic Acids Research, 38:e164, 2010).
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Several features are generated for each gene depending on the type and sequence position of somatic mutations for each tumor sample in
                            the data set. Synonymous, missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutation types are considered. Protein domains including any of these
                            mutation types are annotated as such, with nonsense and frameshift annotations being propagated to all subsequent protein domains.
                            Example associations identified by pairwise statistical tests between these binary somatic mutation annotations and other data types
                            include mutual exclusivity and co-occurrence of genomic events, subtype or other phenotype-associated mutations, and significant changes
                            in gene and miRNA expression, all of which can be viewed within <a href="http://explorer.cancerregulome.org" target="_blank">Regulome Explorer</a>.
